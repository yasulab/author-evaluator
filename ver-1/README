There are 3 ways to put a pointer.
For example, if a following sentence is given,

    "A python user is called pythonista."

and NUM_OF_WORDS is:
    < 0 : The pointer is put from the last.
      	  So, if given -2, it is put as follows:
	-> "A python user is"
	
   == 0 : The point is after the last word.
      	  So, the pointer is put after the last.
      	-> "A python user is called pythonista."
	
    > 0 : The pointer is put from the first.
      	  So, if given 2, it is put as follows:
        -> "A python"
